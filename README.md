# IntelÂ® Generic Parallel Programming Library for Go*

This package provides functions and data structures for expressing
parallel algorithms in Go. It is a fork of the "pargo" library
originally developed at Imec, available at
https://github.com/ExaScience/pargo. This version simplifies parts
of the API, and makes a large part of the functions and types generic
through type parameters. It therefore only works with Go version 1.18
or later. The API is therefore also not compatible with pargo's API.
